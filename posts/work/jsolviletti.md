Recently I was given the chance to design a website for a friend who happens to be a poetry author. The initial website was created with only one of their books in mind. However they were planning on releasing a new book soon and felt that the site needed to be revamped. You can view my redesign for this site via [my Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/bfpSzx3ogPii8730gkMnM5/Janelle-Spaghetti-Website?node-id=0%3A1).

## Home page design

The initial design of the home page was a promo video of the first poetry collection. I knew for both the users experience and for the sake of the second collection that this would have to be changed. I opted for two big color blocks that advertised the two different collections. At the very bottom of the page I weaved in the old author page. I did this for two reasons. The first being, I liked the way it looked (hehe). Secondly the old author page wasn't visited too much, so by merging the pages I had hoped more users would reach this content.

## Poetry collection page design

These were pages that didn't exist before. I kept the same sort of idea from the home page, and populated these pages with the big color blocks from that page. Along with those blocks I included some carousels for sets of images taken by the author. These images were taken with the purpose of being paired with lines of poetry from the different collections. I took this idea and made the carousel of pictures into what looks like a collection of polaroids to give the site a scrapbooky sort of feel.

## Still early

While it's still a little early to tell, I hope that this re-design results in more sales for the author, or at the very least for people to peruse the site a little longer. On the old site most people bounced off the first page pretty quickly, so I'm hoping to at least retain some traffic a little longer. I will update this page as I gain more information on what users are doing on this site.
