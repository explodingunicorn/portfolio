Currently I am working on a smallish side project that I am calling Twitter Haiku. Twitter Haiku pulls allows a user to search for specific Twitter users, the service pulls all of the specific user's tweets and then determines which of those are haikus. Afterwords Twitter Haiku will cache the Haiku-Tweets to allow for a faster re-search. Currently the backend is written in Node.js + Typescript, and the UI is being built with React.js.
